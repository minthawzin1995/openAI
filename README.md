# openAI Environments Learning

- CartPole

CartPole is coded by using reinforcement Learning and Q Learning through neural networks. Code is based on pythonLessons found on youtube.
Small changes are made in this code:
(1) MaxEnvTime to prolong the efficiency of the neural network. 
(2) Memory is increased to 3000
(3) Additional Hidden Layer is added in the neural network.
(4) No random move is made.
(5) Timesteps efficiency reached to 10000.

Last model is saved with the efficiency to stand for 10000 timesteps.
